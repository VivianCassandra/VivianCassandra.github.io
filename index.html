	        Through an unconventional college career, I've had the ability to work to join the field of dietetics.<br>

      <section id="about"> <!-- ABOUT -->

        <p>
            Vivian is a third year Dietetics student at the University of Georgia and plans to graduate in the Spring of 2022.<br>
            She was born in Athens, Georgia and raised in nearby Eatonton, GA.<br><br>
            In high school, she was an active and hard-working student who never said no to anything. She spent her first three years with the marching band, and her senior year decided to take on the costuming process for Putnam County High School's theatre program.<br>
            They placed fourth in the 4-AA State One Act Play performance with "Shrek the Musical."
            <br><br><br>
            She graduated in the top 10% of her class in 2016, Vivian chose to take a year at a smaller school, enrolling at Kennesaw State University in the fall of 2016 majoring in biotechnology.<br>
            While there, Vivian began to realize her real passion was in nutrition and transferred to the University of Georgia in the Fall of 2017.<br>
            <br><br>
            After pursuing her degree for two years at UGA her health began to decline, and with no answers as to why, she put her schooling aside for a few years.<br>
            Vivian returned to classes full-time in the fall of 2020, now having a diagnosis and her health improving.
            <br><br><br>
            Vivian is projected to graduate with a Bachelors of Science in Family and Consumer Sciences from the University of Georgia in the fall of 2022. Afterwards, she hopes to attend a Dietetic Internship and sit for the RDN exam to recieve her license.
            <br><br><br>
            When not at the University, Vivian spends her time with her partner and 2 cats.<br>
            She enjoys discovering new restaurants, reading, and studying folklore.

      <section id="philosophy"> <!-- PHILOSOPHY -->

        <p>
            Dietetics is an unseen field of the medical complex.<br/>
            The lack of eyes on the field have allowed nutritional bloggers, and those with no credentialing or teaching to take over the public’s idea of nutrition.<br>
	        These bloggers and health coaches led to my own weight cycling as a kid.<br/>
            When doctors threatened to put me on cholesterol medication, I was 12. My family didn’t know where to go and without any input from a dietitian my mother tried what she knew best, fad diets.<br/>
            This is what I want to dispel and help the industry move away from.<br>
	        The field of nutrition needs people who are dedicated and unafraid to do the social media work necessary to further the field.<br><br>
            I’m dedicated to putting others before myself, that dedication leads me to want to serve underserved communities in need of nutrition professionals.<br/
            I’m inquiring into obtaining a Masters of Public Health, after my dietetic internship to serve these communities.
